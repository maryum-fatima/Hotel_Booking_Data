# Hotel Booking Data

### Objective: Develop a database to analyze and visualize hotel booking data. 

In this project, I create a database in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, query and analyze with SQL, Integrate Power BI with a Database, and build a visual data story using Power BI to present it to stakeholders.

#### Business Questions:

1) Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
2) Should we increase our parking lot size?
3) What trends can we see in the data? 

#### Summarized Findings:

* The revenue increased from 2018 to 2019 but then it began to decrease from 2019 to 2020.

* As we can observe Parking % is stable so we have enough space for parking. Hence, there is no need to increase our parking lot size. 

* The average daily rate (ADR) has increased from 2019 to 2020, from $99.53 to $104.47.

* Total number of nights booked by customers decreased from 2019 to 2020.

* The discount percentage offered by the hotel has increased from 2019 to 2020 to attract more customers.

#### Tools Used: 

Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Microsoft Power BI.
